# Ladder Approve: Dynamic Multi-Level Leave and Expense Approval for ERPNext

**Ladder Approve** is a powerful custom Frappe app that introduces a **dynamic, multi-level approval workflow** for **Leave Applications** and **Expense Claims** in ERPNext. It automatically routes documents based on reporting hierarchy and empowers HR to act as the final approver. This app enhances control, accountability, and flexibility in organizational approval processes.

## Key Features

### Automated Routing Based on Hierarchy

* Uses the `reports_to` field in the **Employee Doctype** to determine the next approver.
* Documents move up the reporting chain until reaching a user with the **HR Manager** role.

### Final Approval by HR

* Users with the **HR Manager** role act as the final authority.
* Supports organizations with multiple HR Managers.
* Bypasses hierarchy if no more approvers are found.

### Approval History Tracking

* Ensures clear traceability and auditability.

---

### Forwarding Capability

* Mid-level approvers can **forward** documents to their managers instead of finalizing them.
* If no higher manager is found, system sends to any HR Manager.
* Forwarding updates the document with the new current approver.

---

### Smart Permissions & Action Control

* Only the **current approver** has access to submit.
* Uses custom **Permission Query Script** to control visibility based on:

  * Document Owner (Applicant)
  * Current Approver
  * Previous Approvers
  * System Manager / HR Manager / Administrator

---

### Real-Time Email Notifications

Triggered on key transitions:

* Document forwarded to next approver
* Document approved or rejected
* Includes rejection reason if applicable
